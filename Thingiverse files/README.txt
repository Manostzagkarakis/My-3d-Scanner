# Summary

This is an automatic turning platform for 3D scanning with a cellphone. The platform turns the cellphone along a 380mm diameter circle. The turning mechanism is activated by a servo controlled by an Arduino board in a specific sequence which makes pauses to activate the cellphone camera with the Bluetooth remote control. The servo tower can be easily removed to activate the turning mechanism manually with the handle. 
The platform is too big to be printed one shot. One of my goal with this design was not to use any glue or screwâ€¦ only 3D printing (except for attaching the electronics to the platform) . Therefore, I developed different kinds of snaps and shapes to attach parts together. 

Electronic parts:
-Arduino UNO R3  (M.Jduino UNO r3)
-YwRobot Relay
-Generic Bluetooth smartphone selfy remote control
-TowerPro Micro Servo 9g. (I converted the servo to be able to do a continuous turning )

You can find the parts list which includes the parts data such as printing time, estimated filament and price and number of pieces needed. The numbers of the pieces are referenced in the 3D render images of separate parts.
You can also find the code in the txt file.


Here is a video of it in action and the result model. :)

# Post-Printing

## Assembly experiance

I have tested each snap and assembly on partial prints and they all worked fine. When printing  bigger peaces it changes the temperature and therefore the prints are not exactly as the one tested. Therefore i had to file some of the round snap knobs (the long ones) to prevent them from breaking when snapping them with other parts. 
When assembling the top ring, putting the snaps together only rigidify when both sides are snapped correctly. Althow i did'nt want to use any glue, i chickened out on that top ring and put glue in the snap holes before inserting the small "C" clamps. 

If some turning parts are to snuggled, you can put just a tini bit of Jig-a-loo and turn the parts to spread and dry it.
